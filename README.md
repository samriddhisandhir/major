clock routing

This is the implementation of MMM (method of means and medians) algorithm for clock routing problem(CRP)

Guidelines and benchmarks are taken up from ISPD contest 2009 for Clock Tree Synthesis

The link to the contest website : http://www.ispd.cc/contests/09/ispd09cts.html

Here, the guidelines and benchmarks can be found for implementation and also an evaluation script (in perl) is provided for simulation and evaluating the CLR (clock latency rate) along with other parameters. The script takes in the input file, output file and model card file as command line arguments.
